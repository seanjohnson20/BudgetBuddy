<p>The Service is a personal finance information management service that allows Members to consolidate and track their financial information on DogIslandSoftware.com. Based on such information, the Service may also present information relating to third party products or services (“DogIslandSoftware Offers”).</p>

<p>The Service is provided to you by DogIslandSoftware without charge (it is free) and is meant as an aid to assist you in organizing and managing your finances. It is not intended to provide legal, tax or financial advice.</p>

<h5 id="a-4"><a class="toc" href="/how-it-works/security/terms/#toc">Back to Top</a>4.  Account Information from Third Party Sites</h5>

<p>With the Service, Members may direct DogIslandSoftware to retrieve their own information maintained online by third-party financial institutions with which they have customer relationships, maintain accounts or engage in financial transactions (“Account Information”). DogIslandSoftware works with one or more online financial service providers under contract to access this Account Information.
DogIslandSoftware makes no effort to review the Account Information for any purpose, including but not limited to accuracy, legality or non-infringement.  DogIslandSoftware is not responsible for the products and services offered by or on third-party sites. </p>
<p>DogIslandSoftware cannot always foresee or anticipate technical or other difficulties which may result in failure to obtain data or loss of data, personalization settings or other service interruptions. DogIslandSoftware cannot assume responsibility for the timeliness, accuracy, deletion, non-delivery or failure to store any user data, communications or personalization settings. For example, when displayed through the Service, Account Information is only as fresh as the time shown, which reflects when the information is obtained from such sites. Such information may be more up-to-date when obtained directly from the relevant sites. You can refresh your Account Information through the Service, in the manner prescribed in the associated instructions.</p>

<h5 id="a-5"><a class="toc" href="/how-it-works/security/terms/#toc">Back to Top</a>5.  DogIslandSoftware Offers and Third-Party Links</h5>

DogIslandSoftware does not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products or services available through the DogIslandSoftware Offers (or any other third-party products or services advertised on or linked from our site), whether or not sponsored, and DogIslandSoftware is not an agent or broker or otherwise responsible for the activities or policies of those web sites. DogIslandSoftware does not guarantee that the loan, investment, plan or other service terms, rates or rewards offered by any particular advertiser or other third party on DogIslandSoftware.com are actually the terms that may be offered to you if you pursue the offer or that they are the best terms or lowest rates available in the market.</p>

<h5 id="a-6"><a class="toc" href="/how-it-works/security/terms/#toc">Back to Top</a>6.  Your Registration Information</h5>
